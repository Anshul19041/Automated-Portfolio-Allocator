# Automated-Portfolio-Allocator

This project is a Python-based tool that allows investors to automatically allocate a given amount of capital across a portfolio of S&P 500 stocks. The tool fetches real-time stock data, such as prices and market capitalisation, and calculates the number of shares to buy for each stock based on the portfolioâ€™s total value. The final result is exported to an Excel file in a formatted, easy-to-read structure. It is completed in 2 parts. First, we explore the fundamentals, such as data acquisition using APIs, structuring the data, and allocating the investment capital equally among all the stocks. In the 2nd part of the project, we use the data we retrieved using the API call to select the top 50 stocks based on a Quantitative Momentum-based investment strategy and then allocate the investment capital equally among them.
